This is the first file to read the logs from the apache and the share the logs  to the s3 bucket in tar format 

Thing its making sure is 
1. System is updated
2. Apache is installed
3. Apache is ative and enabled
4. Tar the log file generated in the Apache
5. Checking the logs exist or not
6. Moving those file to the s3 bucket 
 
 Thanks for reading
